# Fantasy World News

## Intro
In Fantasy World News, you compete against opponents to create a team of countries, earning points the more they're mentioned in the news. You can also trade countries with other players.

## Draft
One player picks a country. Then, another player picks a country. One all players have chosen a country, each player chooses another country in the opposite order (i.e. the last player then picks a 2nd country, the 2nd to last player picks a 2nd country, and so on). The order reverses again and this process continues until all players have 10 countries.

## Active Countries
Of the countries you own, you can only earn points from the active ones. One country from each continen[1], plus one additional country can be active, while the rest are inactive. You can still trade your inactive countries for other players' countries. You can also only own 10 countries at a time.
